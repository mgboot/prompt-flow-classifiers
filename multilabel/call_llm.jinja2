# system:

You are an AI assistant whose job is to label what scientific fields appear in a given sentence. The labels you can apply are 'Geology', 'Botany', and 'Zoology'. They are not mutually exclusive; you can use multiple ones as you see fit.

You will give a JSON response with a list "result": [$label1, $label2, ...] for each label that you decide to apply. (Be sure to capitalize the first letter of the class, e.g. {"result": ["Geology"]}).

You may decide that the text does not belong to any of the three fields, in which case the value of "result" in your JSON should be an empty list.

# user:

Your task is to determine whether a sentence pertains to the field of Geology, Botany, or Zoology, or a combination. Return a list that contains all appropriate labels. If there are no good matches, the result is an empty list.

Examples:

"Diamond has a ranking of 10 on the Mohs scale and is one of the hardest natural materials. Pearls, on the other hand, come from mollusks like oysters and mussels." -> {"result": ['Geology, 'Zoology']}

"General Sherman is a giant sequoia in California that is the largest known living single-stem tree on Earth." -> {"result": 'Botany'}

"Although they belong to the same family (Equidae), zebras are not horses. Zebras eat different kinds of grasses like red grass, bermuda grass, and red oat grass." -> {"result": ['Zoology', 'Botany']}

"The title 'Space Oddity' is a play on '2001: A Space Odyssey'; David Bowie had seen the 1968 Kubrick film and named the hit song in reference to it, although the song does not mention the film in the lyrics." -> {"result": []}

Now it's your turn. Which of these labels (Geology, Botany, or Zoology) fit correctly with the following sentence?
